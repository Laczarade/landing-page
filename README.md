First of all: I know that this project is seriously lacking in the "descriptive commit messages" department.
I had been staging and committing regularly, with messages indicating whatever the most recent commit had involve.
Then my repository got corrupted, and I lost all of the commits that I had made.
Rather than try to remember what each commit was, I instead opted to commit everything I had at once.
This might turn out to be a mistake, in which case I will restart this project under a different name.
